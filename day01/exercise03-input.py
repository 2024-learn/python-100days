# Instructions
# Try this exercise to understand how tests work with inputs in Auditorium
# Write some code that multiples together the two numbers in the input area. 
# When you run the tests, different hidden inputs will replace the ones in the input area and replace the input() in your code.

# Important
# Your code has to work for all the different input sets. e.g. print(6)would not work, 
# because it only works for one set of inputs. You need to use code to make all the tests pass.

# num1 = int(input())
# num2 = int(input())

# print your code here ðŸ‘‡
print("This program does multiplication of two numbers.")
num1 = int(input("Please enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Please enter the second number: "))

print(num1 * num2)
