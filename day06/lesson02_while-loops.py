# The functions move() and turn_left().
# The condition at_goal() and its negation.
# How to use a while loop.
# Your program should also be valid for world Hurdles 1.

# When to use for loops and when to use while loops
  # use a for loop if you need to iterate over some things and need to do something with each item. 
  # a while loop is better when you do not care where you are in the sequence, the items you are iterating over in a list and you 
  # just want to carry out some sort of functionality until the condition is met
  # NOTE: with for loops the items being iterated over are already set, which is not the case with while loops, 
  # so you have to be careful with while loops, they continue until the condition has been met.
  # if the condition never becomes false, then you are stuck in an infinite loop
  # e.g. 
  # while 5 > 3:  
  #   do something

# Lost in a maze
# Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.

# Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. 
# The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, 
# going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.

# What you need to know
# The functions move() and turn_left().
# Either the test front_is_clear() or wall_in_front(), right_is_clear() or wall_on_right(), and at_goal().
# How to use a while loop and if/elif/else statements.
# It might be useful to know how to use the negation of a test (not in Python).
