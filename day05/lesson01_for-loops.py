# For loop

# for item in list_of_items:
#   do something to each item

fruits = ["apple", "peach", "pear"]

# indentation in for loops makes a difference:
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  print(fruit + " pie")
print(fruits)


for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  print(fruit + " pie")
  print(fruits)
