# Instructions
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. 
# The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

# Write a program that converts their scores to grades.
# By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain 
# student names for keys and their grades for values.

# The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
# DO NOT write any print statements.

# This is the scoring criteria:

# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

# Expected Output
# '{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'

# Hint
# Remember that looping through a Dictionary will only give you the keys and not the values.

# If in doubt as to why your code is not doing what you expected, you can always print out the intermediate values.
# At the end of your program, the print statement will show the final student_scores dictionary, do not change this.

student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,

# TODO-2: Write your code below to add the grades to student_grades.👇
